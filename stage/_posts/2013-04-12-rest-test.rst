       Python  is  an  interpreted,  interactive, object-oriented programming language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
       For an introduction to programming in Python you are referred to the Python Tutorial.  The Python Library Reference documents built-in
       and  standard types, constants, functions and modules.  Finally, the Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the
       core language in (perhaps too) much detail.  (These documents may be located via the INTERNET RESOURCES below; they may  be  installed
       on your system as well.)

       Python's  basic  power  can  be  extended  with your own modules written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be dynamically
       loaded.  Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing applications.  See the internal documentation for hints.

       Documentation for installed Python modules and packages can be viewed by running the pydoc program.

     Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text files
     and to do system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

     If you want a language for easy object-oriented programming, or you don't like the Perl ugliness, or you do like the concept of LISP,
     but don't like too many parentheses, Ruby might be your language of choice.
