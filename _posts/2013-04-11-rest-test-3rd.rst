你好,ReST Test 第三版！

第一节

     Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text files
     and to do system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

     If you want a language for easy object-oriented programming, or you don't like the Perl ugliness, or you do like the concept of LISP,
     but don't like too many parentheses, Ruby might be your language of choice.
